It is rarely in another form of content other than written text that can convey the same depth of a topic.</p> <p>Most content about topics are shallow and surface-level, mainly because the algorithm for various social media sites reward creators that can reach out to a vast audience, which means that their content are generally more broad and do not drill into the deeper areas of a topic. Even with the advent of LLMs, anyone who has tried to understand a topic deeply will know that it is very difficult to get the LLM to explain something deeply. It will most times simply agree with your and echo your ideas. And you end up relying on the LLM to cover your edge cases that you were just fed, none the wiser about real-world edge cases that you are missing. Essentially you are letting the LLM \"ownself check ownself\" when it is clearly unreliable in that aspect.</p> <p>For example, when writing test cases for a program in a new language, asking an LLM to cover \"all\" edge cases can be misleading. The LLM will confidently claim it's covering everything, but without domain experience or understanding of idiomatic testing practices, you will probably miss many critical real-world scenarios that only come with practical experience. </p> <p>An occurance that's far too common</p> <p>\"You're right!

During this time, I did not anticipate one of the hardest things to overcome (I am still in the process of doing so) - loneliness, isolation, and an unassuming routine. For me, it was really easy to constantly feel left out from my friends and peers back home in Singapore. </p> <p>Feeling left out because I'm taking a different path from them, one that promised a greater understanding of the epicentre of software innovation flush with VC money, at the cost of being a year behind my peers. It feels like I voluntarily set myself behind my friends. As such, voices would start creeping into my head, mostly doubting if what I'm doing here would really benefit me in the long run. Asking myself \"what if this decision to stay an extra year and come to the US was just a big waste of time?\". </p> <p>But then the more I enjoyed understanding deeper about topics I was interested in, the more I practiced for the sake of exercising my mental muscles, the more I played basketball and hit the gym, the less these thoughts would occur. The more I started caring more about myself and clearing my head naturally with exercise, the less these thoughts would seem to come. I also realised that life isin't really an equation. You can work hard and be unlucky. You can work less and be lucky. Comparison is natural, but I guess a glance at these things only from time to time and rather sticking to following on my North Star feels better. And it results in personal growth. I wouldn't say that personally personal growth feels \"amazing!\" but it is satisfying and thats better than sitting around and wallowing in my perceived inadequateness compared to others.</p> <p>Especially after the gym + basketball + a good shower (I love the gym shower), my head feels clear and quiet. There are no \"I'm tired\" or \"lets take a break\" thoughts. I actually felt it coming out when I parked my car coming home from the gym, and was able to consciously block it out, mainly because of good energy levels. </p>"},{"location":"posts/2025-06-14-social-media-detox-and-personal-growth/#thinking-less","title":"Thinking less","text":"<p>A thought that creeps in too often</p> <p>I don't remember being this tired when I was a teenager - I must be getting old.</p> <p>This was a common thought that came to my head. Very insidious because I only realised halfway through my time in the US that this thought would lead to almost blind acceptance that either: I was tired and I should beat myself up over feeling tired, or I am old and getting tired.</p> <p>I was talking to my roomate about my tuition teacher back in Secondary School, Miss Catherine. I remember greatly pulling my math grades from a fail to an A in a few months. Because there would be 3x 3 hour sessions where she would just give us a bunch of questions to do after teaching a topic for 30 minutes. I then recalled that during those 3 hour sessions, sometimes it would be straight after school where I was sweaty and nasty. Sitting in a cold air conditioned room. </p> <p>I actually remembered that I was actually tired as well! I remember fighting for my life to keep my eyes open, and how Miss Catherine would sternly mention my name and I'd almost jump out of my seat. She'd tell me to go wash my face and come back. And thats what I ended up doing. I didn't overthink it back then. I accepted that I was tired, but I had to continue and just did it without any extra energy spend on telling myself that this was what discipline looked like, etc. I just did it. Yea I was tired but I just came back to do it without really thinking much. </p> <p>So this kind of ties in to the previous point on energy levels. The greater the energy levels, the less these thoughts happen. And when I'm feeling tired, the less I overthink and I just take a break and come back to doing it.</p>"},{"location":"posts/2025-06-15-whats-the-best-way-to-practice-leetcode/","title":"Whats the best way to practice leetcode?","text":"<p>As of this date, I've been semi-consistently practicing leetcode. I do it when I can, and when I'm not too drained from the day.</p> <p>I recently had a conversation with a friend, reminiscing about the time long ago when I was doing math practice at my tuition teacher's house. It certainly was very gruelling - out of the 3 hours or so spent there, 30 minutes was dedicated to learning about the topic, and 2.5 hours was dedicated to practicing learned concepts.</p> <p>I remember each student in her class being given a photocopied page of the textbook practice page for the topic being taught that day. You know, the page at the back with questions ranging from \"basic\" to \"put on your thinking caps!\".</p> <p>What she would do is let us off for a 5 minute break right before we commenced that practice session, and after she completed teaching that topic.</p> <p>We'd come back from the break, and each person would have a textbook as well as the photocopied practice page. There'd also be an oreo packet or some snack, all placed neatly for everyone.</p> <p>We'd start doing the topic, and this is the key part - I now remember flipping back and forth from the practice questions and the formulae in the book. Why is this key? This is key because my mathematical agility and accuracy increased slowly but surely, and by the end of that practice session, I felt like I knew how to apply the concept to any question of decent difficulty. Did I prevent myself from looking back at the answer? No! Each time I forgot how to apply the formula, I just looked back at the topic, and eventually the mind would just start remembering the formula, after continuous practice. </p>"},{"location":"posts/2025-06-15-whats-the-best-way-to-practice-leetcode/#looking-at-the-answers","title":"Looking at the answers","text":"<p>Much like leetcode, when attempting a new topic in the Neetcode 150 list, somehow I never knew how much overthinking I was doing - preventing myself from looking at the answer.

Much like how solving a trigonometric problem involving algebraic formulas is not possible if I'm not at least decent in algebra, I'll have a really hard time trying to remember so many things at once. The formula, the concept, the language. Too many things at once, stemming from a lack of practice of foundational grammar, will muddy the learning process of the core topic at hand.</p> <p>How do I then tackle topics?</p> <p>While thats a question I'm still in the process of answering, I'll be trying to focus on the learning of the topic at hand first, instead of trying to tackle everything at once. </p> <p>This means spending some time at least to understand the question, then seeing the answer. Then trying to apply the answer by \"flipping back and forth\"!</p> <p>I'll tag the question as completed, but I'll also note that it was my first time completing the question (for that topic). I will then try to reduce the time taken to complete the question in the future, and log every future attempt.</p> <p>Notes on the question should be written somewhere, with intent. I will keep a notion tracker to read my notes on each question.</p> <p>Another thing I did remember from her practice sessions was this - she'd go through select questions in the practice page in the last 30 minutes of the class. While she didn't tell us explicitly why she did this (we also didn't question it), I can only reverse engineer her rationale. That is, she did it because those questions specifically are just a little bit off the standard solution for the questions.</p> <p>I also remember skipping some questions and going on to the next question.

But the main point is - those days I recalled being so tired, and I would be fighting to keep my eyes open during the session. However, her strictness, which manifested in short and sharp callings of whoever is falling asleep, combined with a \"Lets try to complete this practice page\" mentality, allowed me to push through (yes I was sent to the washroom to wash my face and come back) and complete the session. </p> <p>As such I think that having a clear goal for the session (complete 3 questions to gain an understanding of the topic) and having a set session time are key things that would really help. It would help stave off the \"oh lets just do it tomorrow\" or \"I'm so sleepy - you need a break\" mental voices. Of course also setting time aside to just do this and not letting other stuff overlap into this time are also key!</p> <p>This is a key issue that I realised when trying to practice during internship times.
