# About Me

I'm Gabryel, a CS Junior at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) focused on backend development and building scalable applications with ML and AI. When I'm not coding, I'm at the gym or playing basketball.

## Projects I'm currently working on 

I'm trying to push myself with progressive overload:

* Developing an open-source Spring Boot authentication microservice thats configurable and reusable for projects requiring user authentication and authorization, allowing developers to focus on building core features rather than spending precious time making this service.
* Developing a video summarization application that allows professionals to quickly skim through informational content like keynote speeches, long lectures, etc.
* Developing a contribution rules enforcer for merging codebases or large PRs.
* Contributing to open-source projects that I happen to use and take an interest in and seem active enough.

## Tech Stack (that I use very often and are my go-to)

**Backend**: Java, Springboot, Python, FastAPI

**Databases**: PostgreSQL

**Tools**: Docker, AWS, Git
