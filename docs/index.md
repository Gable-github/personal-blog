# Hey there! I'm Gabryel. 

I don't know how you made it here, but this is essentially my safe space to blurt out my thoughts that fill my mental space. If you're looking for a professional version of me look here -> [gabryelsoh.com](https://gabryelsoh.com).

## Writing freely

As I grow older, most of the things that I write are meant to be seen, checked and "graded" or feedback-ed by others. This blog is meant to be a space where I just speak freely, with nobody's feedback. I find it liberating, to be able to write with almost no standard form or function :)

## Contents of this personal blog

Maybe one day I'll organize the contents in this blog neat and nicely, but for now, being a mishmash of my personal journey, passions, and random thoughts possibly surrounding nostalgia is what you'll get.

Check out the [Blog section](posts/index.md) to see all my posts.
